# PSoC 6 CSDADC Middleware

This library provides an API that enables the ADC functionality of the CSD hardware block. It can be useful for devices that do not include another ADC option. The CSD HW block enables multiple sensing capabilities on PSoC devices including self-cap and mutual-cap capacitive touch sensing solutions, a 10-bit ADC, IDAC, and Comparator.
